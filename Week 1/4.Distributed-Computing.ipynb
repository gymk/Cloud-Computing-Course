    "# Distributed Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different systems distributed over a particular Geographical space\n",
    "    - May be within a lab or a real large geographical space\n",

    "\n",
    "## Required aspect:\n",
    "- Network Link\n",
    "    - For seemless connectivity/ collaboration between distributed computers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Distributed Systems\n",
    "- Internet\n",
    "- ATM (bank) machines\n",
    "- Intranets / Workgroups\n",
    "- Computing landscape will soon consist of uniquitous network connected devices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computers in a Distributed System\n",
    "- __*Workstations*__: Computers used by end-users to perform computing\n",
    "- __*Server Systems*__: Computers which provide resources and services\n",
    "- __*Personal Assistance Devices*__: Handheld computers connected to the system via a wireless communication link\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Properties of Distributed Computing\n",
    "- Fault tolerance\n",
    "    - When one or more nodes fails, the while system can still work fine except performance\n",
    "    - Need to check the status of each node\n",
    "- Each node play partial role\n",
    "    - Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system\n",
    "    - Each computer may know only one part of the input\n",
    "- Resource sharing\n",
    "    - Each user can share the computing power and storage resource in the system with other users\n",
    "- Load sharing\n",
    "    - Dispatching several tasks to each nodes can help share loading to the whole system\n",
    "- Easy to expand\n",
    "    - We expect to use few time when adding nodes. Hope to spend no time if possible\n",
    "    - Possibility to add more systems as and when\n",
    "- Performance\n",
    "    - Parallel computing can be considered as a subset of distributed computing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Distributed Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The driving force of Distributed Computing\n",
    "    - Nature of application\n",
    "    - Performance\n",
    "        - Computing intensive\n",
    "            - The task could consume a lot of time on computing.\n",
    "                - For example, Computing of $Pi$ value using Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "        - Data intensive\n",
    "            - The task that deals with a large amount or large size of files.\n",
    "                - For example, Facebook, LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experimental data processing\n",
    "    - Robustness\n",
    "        - No SPOF (Single Point Of Failure)\n",
    "        - Other nodes can execute the same task executed on failed node\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Distributed Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications that consist of a set of processes that are distributed across a network of machines and work together as an ensemble to solve a common problem\n",
    "    - This is useful where\n",
    "        - Large scale application development\n",
    "            - Each(?) part of the application handled by different computer\n",
    "        - Large scale operational need\n",
    "            - Different operation being served by different computer\n",
    "- In the past, mostly \"client-server\"\n",
    "    - Resource management centralized at the server\n",
    "- \"Peer to Peer\" computing represents a movement towards more \"truly\" distributed applications\n",
