    "- __Network Dependency__\n",
    "  - Depending on the configuration (e.g., single physical site, protected cloud network), the network depedency for an on-site private cloud may be limited to dependence on networking resources over which a consumer has control (e.g., local area network LAN).\n",
    "- __Subscribers still need IT Skills__\n",
    "  - Subscriber organizations will need the traidional IT skills required to manage user devices that access the Private Cloud, and will require cloud IT skills as well\n",
    "- __Workload locations are hidden from clients__\n",
    "  - To manage a cloud's hardware resoruces, a private cloud must be able to migrate workloads between machines without inconveniencing clients.\n",
    "  - With an on-site private cloud, however, a subscriber organization chooses the physical infrastructure, but individual clients still may not know where their workloads physically exist within the subscriber organization's infrastructure\n",
    "- __Risks from multi-tenancy__\n",
    "  - Workloads of different clients may reside concurrently on the same systems and local networks, separated only by access policies implemented by a cloud provider's software.\n",
    "  - A flaw in the software or the policies could compromise the security of a subscriber organization by exposing client workdloads to one another\n",
    "- __Data import/export, and performance limitaions__\n",
    "  - On-demand bulk data import/export is limited by the on-site private cloud's network capacity, and real-time or critical processing may be problematic because of networking limitations.\n",
    "- __Potentially strong security from external threats__\n",
    "  - In an on-site private cloud, a subscriber has the option of implementing an appropriately strong security perimeter to protect private cloud resources against external threats to the same level of security as can be achieved for non-cloud resources\n",
    "- __Significant-to-high up-front costs to migrate into the cloud__\n",
    "  - An on-site private cloud requires that cloud management software be installed on computer systems within a subscriber organization.\n",
    "  - If the cloud is intended to support process-intesive or data-intensive workloads, the software will need to be installed on numerous commodity systems or on a more limited number of high-performance systems.\n",
    "  - Installing cloud software and managing the installtions will incur significant up-front costs, even if the cloud software itself is free, and even if much of the hardware already exists within a subscriber organization\n",
    "- __Limited resources__\n",
    "  - An on-site private cloud, at any specific time, has a fixed computing and storage capacity that has been sized to correspond to anticipated workloads and cost restrictions"
