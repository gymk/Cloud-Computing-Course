    "\n",
    "- A cluster is a type of parallel or distributed computer system, which consists of a collection of inter-connected stand-alone computers working together as a single integrated computing resource.\n",
    "- Key components of a cluster include multiple standaline computers (PCs, Workstations, or SMPs), operating systems, high-performance interconnects, middleware, parallel programming environments, and applications"

    "\n",
    "- Clusters are usually deployed to improve speed and/ or reliability over that provided by a single computer, while typically being much more cost effective than single computer (of comparable speed or reliability)\n",
    "- In a typical cluster:\n",
    "    - Network: Faster, closer connection than typical network (LAN)\n",
    "    - Low latency communication protocols\n",
    "    - Loosely coupled than SMP"

    "- __*Hardware Fault Tolerance*__: Redundancy for most system components (eg. disk-RAID), including both hardware and software.\n",
    "- __*OS and Application Reliability*__: Run multiple copies of the OS and applications, and through this redundancy\n",
    "- __*Scalability*__: Adding servers to the cluster or by adding more clusters to the network as the need arises or CPU to SMP\n",
    "- __*High Performance*__: (running cluster enabled programs)"
