    "- _Utility computing is purely a concept_ which cloud computing practically implements\n",
    "- _Utility computing is a service provisioning model_ in which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to the customer as needed, and charge them for specific usage rather than a flat rate.\n",
    "- This model has the advantage of a low or no initial cost to acquire computer resources; instead, computational resources are essentially rented.\n",
    "- The worl _utility_ is used to make an analogy to other services, such as electrical power, that seek to meet fluctuating customer need, and charge for the resources based on usage rather than on a flat-rate basis. This approach sometimes known as _pay-per-use_.\n",
